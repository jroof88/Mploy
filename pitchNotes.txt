Your investor meeting:
  -Your goal is to get to the next meeting
  -Do your homework. Know to whom you are presenting.
  -Know your narrative. Rehearse. Be confident and "own" it.
  -Listen. Take notes of the questions they ask. Refine and improve. It's a process. You may get rejected many times before you get interest
  -Take concerns seriously. Don't try to minimize challenges. Identify solutions to overcome them. Show creativity.
  -Key question: "Why now?" Business may live or die by the timing of their launch.

30-second elevator pitch:
  -Simple and coherent. Avoid jargon and buzzwords. Wordsmith the message.
  -Key message: We solve __ by providing __ to __ to achieve __. We make money by charing __ for __.
  -Think about how your pitch relates to your audience. Present real-life examples. Use analogies.
  -Remember balance - too much detail and being too vague are equally bad.
  -Focus on natural and passionate delivery. Rehearse until you get the flow right.
  -Open with a catch phrase, joke, question, or an interesting state. First impressions are important.
  -Be prepared for critical follow-on questions:
    -Why are you different and therefore better than similar products?
    -Why is your market worth pursuing?
    -Why is this difficult or other but easy for your team?
  -Close with a specific call to action e.g. investment request. Know what you want to get out of the pitch
